# Sample workflow

This sample workflow models the types of steps you can execute with Nebula. Use
it to familiarize yourself with the Nebula interface. The workflow should appear on the **Workflows** page in
your Nebula web interface. If you don't see it there, add the workflow from our
[examples repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/nebula-workflow-examples/tree/master/example-workflows/sample-workflow) on GitHub.

To run the workflow from the Nebula web interface, click **Workflows** >
**sample-workflow** > **Run**. After the run initiates, the run page opens.

You can access the following information from the sample workflow run page:
-  Click **Graph** to view a visualization of the workflow.
-  Click **Code and data** to view the YAML for the workflow.
-  Click **Logs** and select a step to view the log output for that step.

Next, try sending a Slack notification to your team using the [Slack
notification](./notify-slack.md) workflow.
